- Hello everyone! I am from Thailand and have been living in Germany for almost 2 years. I have studied Applied Physics and Entrepreneur by training. I am new in software engineering, coding or programming. However, I am willing to improve my skills and hopefully we can study and work on the project together. Nice to meet you all!
